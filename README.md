Lagen Browser Development Library
=================================

### What is it?

Lagen is a JavaScript browser development library.  Rather than using a
declarative approach like HTML, Lagen explores an imperative method
of creating browser content.

This system is extremely immature at this point.  It is hoped that
it advances quickly as it is used in a real project.

The main home for this system is: https://github.com/blakemcbride/Lagen
